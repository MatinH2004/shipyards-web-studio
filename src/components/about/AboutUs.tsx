            My name is Matin, and I am the owner and lead developer of Shipyards Web Studio. 
            I got into programming after graduating from high school. Over the course of three years, I enrolled in&nbsp;

            &nbsp;software engineering program and learned everything from creating databases, DSA, 
            the internet and its protocols, back-end servers, front-end design, and building full-stack
            applications from scratch. With these skills, I started reaching out to small businesses to 
            offer my help, and I have been growing every year since 2023.

          <p className="mt-4 text-gray-400 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            What I found was that a lot of small businesses don&apos;t have the funds to spend 
            thousands of dollars upfront on a new website. And the ones that did, got taken 
            advantage of and ended up with a terrible website. They either couldn&apos;t afford 
            a good website, or if they could, they didn&apos;t know who to trust. So I tweaked 
            my business model to fit their needs. That&apos;s how I came up with my $0 down and 
            $199 a month modelâ€”more manageable for a small business and easier on their budget.
